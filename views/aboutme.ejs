                <p>
                I have always been interested in problem solving, math, science, things of that nature,
                and I have always been someone who spent time using computers. Naturally my interest in problem solving,
                and closeness with computers led me to coding. Coding is something I thourougly enjoy, finding an outlet
                where I can spend time solving complex logical issues has been a great gift to me, and is something
                I couldn't give up easily.

                <h2>Struggles i've endured</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="about">
                <p>
                    As I am self taught, i've often struggled managing learning to code, especially at the start, working, spending time with family and friends,
                    and whatever else life might throw at me. This led to me taking breaks while learning and thinking that maybe I shouldn't continue to learn,
                    but as I continued I began to understand what I was learning well and started to build things, and solve coding issues, I didn't face any of those
                    issues anymore. Coding became something that I made time for no matter what because it wasn't a job taking away from my day, it was something I looked
                    forward to doing everyday.

                <p>
                    I have been mainly using JavaScript as of late, building my own websites with a focus in backend development, although I am also interested
                    in frontend development. I want to keep learning JavaScript and it's libraries/frameworks, build more projects, and look for a job where I can 
                    show my skill, and passion for web development, while continuing to learn alongside others in the same field.

                <h2>Why you should give me a chance</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="about">
                <p>
                I am someone with an extreme passion for web development, and coding in general, I am a driven, and fast learner who wants to continue
                improving upon their skillset. To me coding isn't just a job, it's something I love to do, to be able to work and solve problems alongside others
                where I can continue learning more and more would be the perfect setting for me to show I can succeed. A place like that is where I would thrive,
                and spend my days working diligently to complete the tasks given to me, and solve the issues at hand.
