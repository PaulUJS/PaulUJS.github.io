                    RemindMe is a full-stack web app I made using Nodejs, Express, and vanilla JavaScript for the frontend.
                    On RemindMe users can create an account, then login in and create their own list of reminders with dates and times included!
                    RemindMe sends users an email containing all their reminder information a week before the date the user put for the reminder.

                    Flask Blog is a full-stack blog site I made using Python and Flask as the backend, and designed with HTML, and CSS.
                    Flask Blog allows users to create their own account to create, edit, and delete their own blog posts!
                    Users can also see the blog posts made by others on the sites main page.

                    This is somewhat obvious, but you are currently on this site! I made my portfolio site to showcase my projects, my passion
                    for web development, and to show others who I am as a developer.
